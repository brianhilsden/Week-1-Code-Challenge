# Week 1 Code Challenge
#### Date: 22/March/2024

#### By: *Brian Omondi*

## Description
The project tackles three problems presented and builds programs to solve them. They are as follows:
1. A program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between   0 and 100. It then outputs the correct grade: A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40. 
2. A program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints“Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
3. A program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It then calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
